a) angular rate
b) It supports, in the G_ODR, it supports Angular rate output data rate is 416hz and 206hz, 
    meaning that it can produce 1 data per 1/416s or per 1/206s. 
    That also means it can have around 416 or 206 readings per seconds.
c) FIFO stores  the data of gyroscope, accelerometer, and more. And it 
    can produce accelerometer/gyroscope data-ready signal; in which case the ODR 
    must be lower than or equal to both the accelerometer and gyroscope ODRs. 
    With that, we can use verilog to read the internal register with in the FIFO.
